This package is a collection of utilities that can be used to manage the internal functions stored withing a database's `system.js` collection.

**NOTE** In order to use the Git integration, you'll have to use Node.js 0.12.1 or later. If not, you'll be greeted by the following when you try to run the tools:

```
Error: /path/to/mongo-systemjs-tools/node_modules/nodegit/build/Release/nodegit.node: undefined symbol: node_module_register
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
```

## Install

First, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for this, as it greatly simplifies managing node versions.


```sh
$ npm install --save mongo-systemjs-tools
```

Or,

```sh
$ git checkout https://github.com/dacgroup/mongo-systemjs-tools
$ cd mongo-systemjs-tools
$ npm install
```

## Usage

## systemjs-dump

This utility is used to dump all *system.js* functions to file for a specific database.

```sh
$ node systemjs-dump.js --url <mongouri>
```

## systemjs-monitor

This utility can monitor a [replicaset](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/replication/) for changes, and dump those to local files.

Optionally, those files can be checked into and pushed to a remote Git repository.

### Configuration

Configuration options for the utilities within this package can be found within the `config.json` file.

For example:

``` json
{
    "databaseUrl" : "mongodb://username:password@serverip:port/database?options",
    "outDir": "/path/to/data",
    "logLevel": "debug",
    "gitAuthor": "MongoBot",
    "gitAuthorEmail": "noreply@dacgroup.com"
}
```

* `databaseUrl`: the connection string should follow the format described in [the mongo connection string docs](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string).
* `outDir`: the target path where data should be written (defaults to *./out*).
* `logLevel`: the debug level to set for the internal logger (defaults to *./info*).
* `gitEnabled`: if set to *true*, commit changes to a repository and then attempt to push those changes to the **origin** remote (defaults to *false*).
* `gitAuthor`: the name to use as the commit author if pushing to Git (defaults to *MongoBot*).
* `gitAuthorEmail`: the email address to associate with the *gitAuthor* (defaults to *./info*).

### Git Integration

If the `gitEnabled` option is set, the `outDir` can be Git-enabled by setting up a local repo.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/outDir
$ git init
```

If you would like **systemjs-monitor** to push updates to a remote server (ex: [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com)), a [remote](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) would need to be defined.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/outDir
$ git remote add origin <remote url>
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add a lot more error handling
- [ ] Allow Git initialization of data directory (so user doesn't have to do it manually)
- [ ] Extract Git functionality so it can be used with *systemjs-dump* as well
- [ ] Add hooks to allow external integration (ex: [mongo-linter](https://github.com/dacgrouplabs/mongo-linter))
- [ ] Add tests!
